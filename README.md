# Embrace-Creatives-Senior-Project
This repository is a version history of the source code and documentation for CSC 4996: Embrace Creatives Capstone Project for Wayne State University. Within this repositary will be a working version of our website as per our client Andrea Bogart's request. This is a functional website developed by Embrace Creatives team members. 

# Project Overview
The Embrace Creatives development team is devoted to creating a dynamic website for our client representing the Embrace Creatives platform for artists and buyers. Embrace Creative is a website that aims to let artists showcase and sell their work to retail and wholesale customers. Embrace Creatives also provides a platform for buyers to find and contact artist's directly. 

Currently our client is operating their business on wordpress, and sought to transition to having their own site. The client required a platform for two different types of users, artist and businesses, along with options to become paid members.

Our solution included creating a new site using html, css, bootstrap 4, and a sql server to handle the database requirements.
<ul>
  <li>We migrated all of the clients existing users to a new database, created a shop page for artists to sell retail and whole sale, a page for events to be advertised, a page for grants to be advertised, and a platform for business users to contact and purchase specific pieces from artists directly at bulk quantities.</li>
  </ul>

# Scope
The central goal of this website is to create a platform for artists to sell retail and for businesses to find artists to buy wholesale.

This project will consist of a full front-end redesign and implementation of a new website. It will conform to itâ€™s own code, and performance standards as set by the team and style standards as set by the client through provided templates.

The website will provide various functionalities based on the type of user, with the core ones being the ability for artists to sell to retail or wholesale customers, and the ability for businesses to find and contact artists directly for bulk orders and see bulk pricing.
