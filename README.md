# Project Overview

Embrace Creative is a website that aims to let artists showcase and sell their work to retail and wholesale customers. Embrace Creatives also provides a platform for buyers to find and contact artist's directly. 

Currently our client is operating their business on wordpress, and sought to transition to having their own site. The client required a platform for two different types of users, artist and businesses, along with options to become paid members.

   <li>Search function for users to quickly find what they are looking for. 
   <li>A grant feature for business users to support and fund artists by adding different types of opportunities. 
   <li>An art call feature for business users to showcase different types of art call opprtunities for the artists to sell their best artworks. </li>
    <li> A blog feature for authors and admin to express their thoughts and opinions. 
    <li> Profile editing function is available for the registered users in the website. This function is implemented for the users to take advantage of including addtional information to let other others know more about themselves.</li>
